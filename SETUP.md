# Setup a twitter account for distinct

Distinct uses the twitter streaming API. To use it, you need your own twitter account with Twitter API keys.

Here are the steps required:

1. Create a twitter account.

2. Visit https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps and log in.

3. Click _Create new app_.

4. Fill out the form, agree to the terms and click _Create your Twitter application_.

5. Visit the _Keys and tokens_ tab and put the _API key_ and the _API secret_ in your `distinct.ini` file as consumer_key and consumer_secret.

6. Click _Create my access token_ and copy the _Access token_ and _Access token secret_ to the `distinct.ini` file also.

That's it!
