# Setup a Mastodon account for distinct

## This file needs an overhaul for Mastodon!

Distinct uses the Mastodon streaming API. To use it, you need your own Mastodon account with API keys.

Here are the steps required:

1. Create a Mastodon account.

2. Visit https://docs.joinmastodon.org/client/token/#creating-our-application

3. Create a token and put it in your `distinct.ini` file as consumer_key and consumer_secret.

That's it!
