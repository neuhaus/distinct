# distinct
This twitter bot will retweet someone's tweet only if that person hasn't tweeted 
something with the same URL in the past. The name "distinct" was chosen for the SQL [SELECT DISTINCT](https://www.w3schools.com/Sql/sql_distinct.asp) statement.

Follow distinct bots instead of the original twitter accounts and enjoy duplicate-free tweets!
